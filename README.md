# AI Marketing Engine for Developers

Most developers can build.
Most developers cannot market.

This open-source project is an AI-powered marketing system designed specifically for developers, indie hackers, and Web3 builders who want **users, not noise**.

No gurus.  
No paid ads.  
No fake growth hacks.  

Just clear positioning, repeatable systems, and execution.
